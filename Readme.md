## **Using the `exn` Module: A Comprehensive Guide**

The `exn` module serves as a connector, enabling communication between various components in a messaging infrastructure. This guide will take you through the basics to advanced usage of the module.

### **Overview**

- **Core Components:**
    - **Bootstrap**: A foundational class setting up the readiness state.
    - **CoreHandler**: Manages connection start, message reception, and timed tasks.
    - **EXN**: Main connector class initializing connections and configurations.

### **Basic Usage**

1. **Initialize** the `EXN` class:

    ```python
    connector = connector.EXN('ui', bootstrap=Bootstrap())
    ```

2. **Run** the connector to start:

    ```python
    connector.start()
    ```

### **Advanced Usage**

#### **1. Enabling Health and State Monitoring**

The `EXN` class offers two flags: `enable_health` and `enable_state`.

- **`enable_health`:** Enables a scheduled publisher that sends a health-check ping at regular intervals.
- **`enable_state`:** Activates the `StatePublisher` to manage and signal the lifecycle states of the component.

**Gradual Implementation:**

**a. Basic Setup (No Flags):**

    ```python
    connector = connector.EXN('ui', bootstrap=Bootstrap())
    ```

**b. Health Monitoring:**

    ```python
    connector = connector.EXN('ui', bootstrap=Bootstrap(), enable_health=True)
    ```

**c. Lifecycle State Monitoring:**

    ```python
    connector = connector.EXN('ui', bootstrap=Bootstrap(), enable_health=True, enable_state=True)
    ```

#### **2. The `ready` Function**

The `ready` function in your Bootstrap class is called when the component is initialized. Use it to perform specific operations at startup:

Example:

```python
def ready(self, context):
    if context.has_publisher('state'):
        context.publishers['state'].starting()
```

#### **3. The Importance of the 'key' Argument**

Each publisher is identified using a unique 'key', which is crucial when handling multiple publishers:

Example:

```python
context.publishers['state'].starting()
```

Here, 'state' is the 'key' for a specific publisher, directing it to send a 'starting' signal.

### **Working with Context**

The `Context` class in the `core` section aids in managing publishers and consumers within the application. Here's how:

- Register a publisher:

    ```python
    context.register_publisher(publisher)
    ```

- Check if a publisher exists:

    ```python
    context.has_publisher('key')
    ```

- Build an address from a link:

    ```python
    context.build_address_from_link(link)
    ```

### **Conclusion**

The `exn` module provides a robust platform for component communication, health and lifecycle management, and more. Whether you're looking for simple connectivity or advanced message routing with multiple publishers, this module has got you covered.
